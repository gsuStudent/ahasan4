	This game was created by 3 Computer Science Students, Samir, Greg, and Abir at Georgia State University.
The game was driven by the idea of creating a game that was both accessible and fun to young adults. The contents of the game was started by Samir and later fleshed out by Abir. Greg added the finishing touches to what see you right now. Our mission statement can be accessed easily from the game menu.
