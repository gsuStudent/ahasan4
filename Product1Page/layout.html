<p>The layout for the <span class="gameof30">Game of 30</span> is simplistic to undertand. There are 5 main zones within the game. Each zone in the game has one basic function. Below, are an explaination of each zone and their functions.</p>

<p><img src="deckzone.png" id="deckzone">
The first zone is called the <span id="deck">Deck Zone.</span> As the name suggest, this is the zone in which the entire deck is placed. All card effects related to drawing, returning , and discarding cards will take place within this zone. This zone is highlighted in blue. The <span id="deck">Deck Zone</span> is located in the upper righthand side of the board. </p>

<p><img src="facezone.png"id="facezone">
	Directly below the <span id="deck">Deck Zone</span> is the <span id="face">Face Zone.</span> This is the part of the board wherein all face cards are placed. Face cards constitutes of <span class="facecards">King, Queen, Jack, and Joker.</span> Each of these cards will activate their effects within this zonal area. However, any animation regarding the deck will occur in the <span id="deck">Deck Zone.</span> This zone is highlighted in white.
</p>
<p><img src="point.png" id="point">
	Directly to the left of the <span id="deck"> Deck Zone</span> and <span id="face">Face Zone </span> is the 
	<span class="point">Point Zone.</span>This zone will keep a track of all accumulation and losses of points during the duration of the game. The zone is highlighted in orange.Any effects regarding the accumulation and loss of points will be shown here. If a <span class="facecards">King</span> is drawn, this zone will glow in blue signalling that the player will have immunity to <span class="acejoker">Joker</span> for one turn. If a <span class="acejoker"> Joker</span> is drawn, <span class="point">this zone will glow red, and any accumulated points will turn into zero,</span> signalling the loss the of the game. However, if a <span class="facecards">King</span> was drawn the previous turn, the zone will remain normal, and the loss off the player points will not occur.

The first of these zones is the <span class="playzone">Play Zone.</span> The <span class="playzone">Play Zone</span> is capable of holding 11 cards at maximum. All numerical cards from 1-9 will be played within this zone.
